# Fafnir
Coming Soon...


**Symbol/Virtue:** Transformation  
Fafnir, originally a giant in Norse mythology, undergoes a transformation into a dragon to guard his treasure. While often representing greed, Fafnir also embodies adaptation and transformation, reflecting the evolving nature of security protocols.

## Overview

**Fafnir** is a standalone encryption library designed for developers to easily implement robust security protocols in their applications. Whether for **data at rest** or **data in transit**, Fafnir offers flexibility and ease of integration, with support for various encryption algorithms and authentication methods.

### Key Features (Coming Soon):
- **Configurable Encryption**: Choose from multiple encryption algorithms tailored to your needs.
- **Data Protection**: Secure sensitive data both at rest (stored data) and in transit (data being transferred).
- **Authentication Methods**: Implement strong authentication protocols to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of communications.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs that allow developers to quickly integrate encryption into their own codebases with minimal effort.

### Current Status
This repository is currently a placeholder as **Fafnir** is being actively developed. More features and implementation details will be available soon.
